# Self_Driving_Car_Behavioral_Cloning
This project was the most fun and is my favourite. It uses Deep Learning algorithm for training of the self driving car around a virtual track. The car is trained manually first and then allowed to drive on its own. The Deep Learning algorithm determines the steering angle while the speed is fixed at 9 mph.
